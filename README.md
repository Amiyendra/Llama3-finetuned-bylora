# 🦙 LLaMA 3 Legal Assistant Fine-Tuning

Welcome to the **LLaMA 3 Legal Assistant** fine-tuning project! ⚖️🤖  
This repository contains code and assets for fine-tuning the LLaMA 3 model on legal domain data using LoRA adapters.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project fine-tunes a large language model (LLaMA 3) to assist with legal text understanding and generation. It uses **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for efficient fine-tuning. The goal is to build a powerful AI assistant specialized in legal language.

## 📂 What’s inside?

- `legalfinetuning.ipynb` — Fine-tuning notebook with all training steps  
- Tokenizer files:  
  - `tokenizer.json`  
  - `tokenizer_config.json`  
  - `special_tokens_map.json`  
- Scripts and utilities used during fine-tuning (if any)  
- This README.md with project info  

> ⚠️ Model weights (`.safetensors`) are **not included** here due to large size. You can find the trained model on [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/AmiyendraOP/llama3-legal-finetuned).

## 📦 How to use

1. Clone this repo  
2. Download the model weights from Hugging Face Hub  
3. Load the tokenizer and model using the scripts or notebook  
4. Run inference or continue training
